# Game-Mod-Q4
The DeckBuilder Branch contains my midterm mod.
To install just move the DeckBuilder folder that is within that branch into the quake4 root directory.

How to play
You select the card to play by using the mousewheel and it should show up on the HUD in the bottom left above heath.
You then press _key_ to activate the selected card playing it and then moving it from the hand to the discard pile.
